# RGB and Fan Stuff
Since I am a Pretty Boi who likes RGB, I need some software to make sure my lights are in sync. (Even to make some of my fans turn on, curse you, Lian Li)

## Motherboard ARGB Control
[OpenRGB](https://openrgb.org/#downloads) should solve my problems here

## Corsair RAM RGB Control
[OpenRGB](https://openrgb.org/#downloads) should solve my problems here, too

## Gigabyte GPU RGB Control
[OpenRGB](https://openrgb.org/#downloads) should solve my problems here, too. Wow.

## Lian Li Fan Control
Hard wired my fan power cables to my motherboard, lol. And OpenRGB does the rest
