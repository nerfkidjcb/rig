# Drives

## 128GB Kingston USB
Not technically a drive on this PC but no doubt I'll keep booting off of this enough to call it a permanent feature...

## 1TB Crucial T705 1TB SSD PCIe Gen5 
Bought this specifically for the Linux experience. Hoping for boots faster than you can spot a Gillet at Canary Wharf. All things Linux will live here

## 4TB Samsung 990 Evo Plus SSD
This has 4 partitions for windows (<500GB) 2TB for shared games NTFS, and 1.2TB for Media ext4. each partition replaces my old windows, media, and 2tb games drive for a two drive setup
