# Drives

## 128GB Kingston USB
Not technically a drive on this PC but no doubt I'll keep booting off of this enough to call it a permanent feature...

## 1TB Crucial T705 1TB SSD PCIe Gen5 
Bought this specifically for the Linux experience. Hoping for boots faster than you can spot a Gillet at Canary Wharf. All things Linux will live here

## 2TB Samsung 970 Evo Plus SSD
My NTFS drive with steam games from windows [TODO] Hoping to just mount this and be happy after a few commands without reinstalling all me games

## 512GB Seagate FireCuda 510 SSD
My (ew) Windows installation. I keep this cos it has minecraft and other random Xbox/Windows things that I can't be bothered to replicate. Probably won't mount this to Linux ever, and hope it stays bootable

## 2 TB HDD (Some Seagate thing)
Has backups of things, probably won't let linux touch it until I'm super sure I know what I'm doing
